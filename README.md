# RPS
Greetings!
This is The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissor exercise.
I have intentionally left the first RPS assignment (JS Basics 7) available to view so hopefully somebody out there banging their head on the code can perhaps get an assist without all the 'cluter' of the later assignments.  These can be fund under HTML2 and Script2.  Versions 'script' and 'script1' show part of the evolution in my efforts.
